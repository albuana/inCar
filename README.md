## Introduction

My group was invited to participate in a contest that aims to design applications with innovative characteristics, for creativity and good usability of the interactive systems that it realizes. The two most relevant dimensions for the jury of the contest are the interaction possibilities offered, and the functionalities that can be realized. Thus, at the level of interaction it is expected that the applications offer possibilities of presentation of their contents that go beyond the traditional text. Other possibilities suggested include the use of images, videos, and sounds. Originality and adequacy to the target population, which should be conveniently described, are strongly rated in the evaluation of this item. In terms of functionality, it is expected that the solutions presented offer diversity to the user. Usability and user experience are fundamental aspects. In particular, navigation within the application should be careful, should not be limited to one level, and should facilitate user orientation, avoiding errors. These aspects are taken into consideration by the jury.

The result of our work will be the interface for the application to be presented to the jury of the competition and potential clients, which must support the functionalities desired by the users.

## Project explanation

â–ªï¸Ž Nowadays, we think of autonomous cars and see the user performing a whole range of leisure, productivity, etc... tasks without having to worry about driving it. At the opposite extreme, we have the current reality, where drivers share their attention between the road and additional devices (e.g. tuning the radio). 

â–ªï¸Ž This project seeks to improve the balance between controlling additional devices and the primary task of driving the vehicle. There are examples of controlling car functions by voice and/or buttons on the steering wheel. They should explore what other functions should be included and how best to accomplish them.

â–ªï¸Ž Input (e.g. buttons, voice, touch surfaces) and output mechanisms (e.g. hud, voice, vibration) are at the discretion of the design team. Mechanisms that cannot be implemented may be simulated.
